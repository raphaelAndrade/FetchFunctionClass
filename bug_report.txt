I am writing a bug report instead of "fixing" the bug,
because the cause of the bug presents
an underlying issue with the design pattern of the entire script.
In such case, I believe that a code should be re-written from scratch,
with a design pattern that will make the code maintainable and scalable.

I will not describe which part of the design is unoptimal because I think that
the design pattern for the entire script needs to be resconsidered, not just some parts.
I can verbally explain it to you in person if I must.

The direct cause of the bug is that
the id attributes of the delete buttons of newly created users
are not supplied with user id(s).

I think what needs a "fix" is the whole design pattern, not this specific bug.
This specific bug shed light on the unoptimal design pattern.
